vhosts -- how to do this? I don't like sanic's, maybe do cherrypy's redir
  sanic:
    @app.route('/', host=["example.com",
                      "somethingelse.com",
                      "therestofyourdomains.com"])
  cherrypy:
    conf = {
      "/": {
        "request.dispatch": cherrypy.dispatch.VirtualHost(
          **{
        'api.foo.com':       '/api',



rate limit in C
Make conn/req timeouts as arguments  (20 / 5 right now)

todo add test >128k byte response body to test realloc of response buffer

?? ip = cherrypy.request.remote.ip
Allow setting custom error pages 



Why is 404 so slow?
  raised. We could try to cache it. Create a bytes obj and test just writing that. Or not use the raise method app.404 or something

This is slow so do it in C to speed up forms
  urllib.parse.parse_qsl('foo=bar&baz=foor&dogsdont=likecats')


examples/5_router.py -- methods?

Create an async memcached client - needed for clustering


Look at a mysql C client?  We can do better than aiomysql.  Either libmysqlclient or our own
