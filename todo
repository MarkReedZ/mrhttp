vhosts -- how to do this? I don't like sanic's, maybe do cherrypy's redir
  sanic:
    @app.route('/', host=["example.com",
                      "somethingelse.com",
                      "therestofyourdomains.com"])
  cherrypy:
    conf = {
      "/": {
        "request.dispatch": cherrypy.dispatch.VirtualHost(
          **{
        'api.foo.com':       '/api',
